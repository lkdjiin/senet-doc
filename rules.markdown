Who Plays First
---------------

The player (randomly choosen) with 
the black pieces plays first.


Throwing The Sticks
-------------------

+  1: make your move and then play again
+  2: make your move
+  3: make your move
+  4: make your move and then play again
+  5: make your move and then play again


Moves
------

There can be, at any one time, only one piece on any one house. 

A piece advances as many houses as the player threw.

The player must move a piece forward if he can. If there is no legal forward move possible, then he must
move a piece backward. If there is no legal backward move possible, the throw is forfeited.

When moving to an enemy square, you swap places with this undefended enemy piece (with two pieces
of the same color on consecutive squares being considered to be protecting each other, 
with neither being able to be knocked off).

Three enemy pieces on consecutive squares may not be passed by the opponent.

The Hazardous Squares (26 - 30):

+  26:  You may not move beyond this square until you have landed there by an exact throw, 
        or you may exit directly if you throw a score of 5.
+  27: 	This is the most treacherous square where any piece that lands here must go back 
        to the 15th square.
+  28: 	Must throw a 3 to exit.
+  29: 	Must throw a 2 to exit.
+  30: 	Must throw a 1 to exit.

On square 26 a piece is protected, even if it is alone. 

On squares 28, 29 and 30 yours pieces are never protected. If 
you move backward from one of those square (if it is your only legal move
or your opponent swap you) you fall in water and return to the 15th square.
